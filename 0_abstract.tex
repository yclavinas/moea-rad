MOEA/D decomposes multi-objective problems into single-objective subproblems and solve them in a parallel. In standard MOEA/D, all subproblems receive the same computational effort. However, as each subproblem relates to different areas of the objective space,it is expected that some subproblems are more difficult than others. Using Resource Allocation, MOEA/D could spend less effort on easier subproblems and more on harder ones, improving efficiency. in this paper, ew address Resource Allocation by using priority functions. Therefore, we propose the MOEA/D-RAD, a MOEA/D that considers diversity in the decision space as priority function. We compare MOEA/D-RAD, MOEA/D-DE and MOEA/D-DRA on the BiBBOB benchmark. This benchmark is composed of 55 BiBBOB functions grouped into 15 function classes, given similarity properties. We investigate the performance of MOEA/D-RAD, MOEA/D-DE and MOEA/D-DRA in all of these 15 groups. Exploratory experiment results shows that MOEA/D-RAD outperforms its peers on 24 functions in terms of the hypervolume metric and indicates that MOEA/D-RAD has high hypervolume values in 5 group classes. Among these 5 groups, it performs well in the moderated- and weakly-structured classes. These results validate the effectiveness of using diversity in the objective space as priority function in the MOEA/D framework.
